        <h3>What is [wpv-bloginfo]?</h3>
        <div class="sfc-faq-body" style="display: block;">
            <p>A new way for people to generate a collaboration is through the concept of internet crowdsourcing. The
                concept is fairly simple. [wpv-bloginfo] is the first internet platform that allows people to create, pitch
                and market their idea for a collaboration across the internet. Others on the internet can fund the
                collaboration with certain dollar amount donations. When the YouTubers involved in this campaign decide to
                collaborate with each other 75% of all donations and proceeds will go towards them. The collaborators decide what to do with the money.<br><br>
                [wpv-bloginfo] is the only platform where campaigners and supporters are partnering with us to build a world
                community of ingenious collaborations. Campaign creators and
                contributors are working closely together to make new collaborations come together in real life.<br><br>
                </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What do I need to know before choosing a campaign?</h3>
        <div class="sfc-faq-body">
            <p>When looking at a campaign, one must view it through a philanthropist’s eyes.
                Contributing to a campaign is more like giving somebody an assignment to complete rather than
                acquiring an item from the store or trading stocks. When one supports a campaign, one supports an idea
                and a cause he or she equally has an interest in.<br><br>

                However, before someone makes a contribution to a campaign, we at [wpv-bloginfo] recommend to read these
                suggestions first.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Ensure the person who created the campaign is offering full description with lots of information
                    about the collaboration
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you can identify yourself with the collaboration</li>
                <li>Search and see if you can find more information about the collaboration.</li>
                <li>When you decide to enable [wpv-bloginfo] Smile Mode, select a cause or organization on the checkout page
                    that you can identify yourself with. Read more about [wpv-bloginfo] Smile so you know your
                    money is
                    in good hands and will have a great impact
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <p>For many contributors, the rewarding part comes in the form of watching the campaign, from the idea to making
            the collaboration happen in real life.<br><br>

            One must also acknowledge the risks involved in such an endeavor. In preliminary stages, unanticipated
            delays and challenges can arise, and there is always the additional risk the collaboration will be
            unsuccessful.
            </p>

        <h3>How are contributors protected?</h3>
        <div class="sfc-faq-body">
            <p>A level of security is necessary and needed by contributors before they start supporting a campaign. Contributors need to feel safe and secure that their money is going to an honest campaign, and there is
                validation behind their donations. [wpv-bloginfo] provides the trusted platform which contributors are seeking
                in crowdsourcing a collaboration. <br><br>
                <strong>Trust & Safety</strong><br><br>
                [wpv-bloginfo] mission is to provide a safe and trusted platform for contributors to choose a campaign to support on a crowdsourcing sight; while simultaneously uniting people globally around ideas and
                collaborations that are important to them and then empowering those people to see those collaborations
                become a reality.<br><br>

                Watching every campaign grow from an idea to an extraordinary collaboration, we want every contributor
                to be well informed. [wpv-bloginfo] provides all the information and a global community built on trust
                and passion for seeing “dream collaborations come true”, and the security needed for the donors to feel
                confident supporting their favorite campaign.<br>
                Frequently, we may get asked certain questions about the viability of certain campaigns. First, we
                encourage everybody to evaluate the campaign on their own. We want contributors to be as
                informed as possible; learn about the campaign by reading more about the suggested collaborators, their
                biographies, updates, and comments.<br><br>

                Ask yourself is this a collaboration I can relate to or get excited about? We encourage everybody to be
                involved in the discussion/in the comments.
                As part of a global community, if one has a question, it is probably a question somebody else has and
                should be added to the campaigns updates/comments.

        <h3>What is the role of the contributor?</h3>
        <div class="sfc-faq-body">
            <p>[wpv-bloginfo] and all campaigns could not be successful without the unbelievable aid of our community of
                donors. Therefore, we are dedicated to securing donors with the information, tools and safety needed to
                determine a donation to a campaign. We realize our contributors have the ability to make a new collaboration
                happen each time they support a campaign. We agree that this can be filled with both risks and rewards,
                but we want our contributors feeling confident and excited on the journey. The key is trust between all three
                parties: [wpv-bloginfo], the campaign creators, and the donor.<br>
                It’s with trust and support that great collaborations come to life.

        <div class="sfc-faq-body">
            <p>Often, potential donors are able to locate new campaigns through recommendations from friends. When an
                individual finds an exciting new campaign, sharing links to the campaign through social media, email or
                messaging apps, it’s often the best way to spread the word. Other sources for potential donors who are
                looking for new campaigns include</p><br><br>

        <h3>Anything I should know before contributing?</h3>
        <div class="sfc-faq-body">
            <p>

                <strong>Difficulties with Contributions</strong><br><br>
                Sometimes a transaction fails, causing problems with a contribution. This can be due to Browser issues,
                credit card blocks, etc., but a few simple solutions exist.
                You will know your donation was successful when you are directed to a thank-you page and when you
                receive an automatic email confirmation.<br><br>

                <strong>Common Contribution Errors and their Solutions</strong><br><br>

                <strong>Country:</strong> If your country is not listed in the drop-down list when trying to donate by
                credit
                card, your country may not be supported at this time<br>
                <strong>Restrictions:</strong> We are currently only accepting payments from direct credit/debit cards and via Apple
                Pay and Paypal<br><br>
                <strong>Credit/Debit Card:</strong> For the immediate future, if you choose to use a direct credit or
                debit card, we
                advise that most offerings accept Visa and MasterCard. Gift carts, pre-paid value cards and debit
                cards without the Visa or MasterCard logos are not accepted. Product funding in USD may also be paid
                with American Express; Discover Card may be used for accounts located within the U.S.
                If you are funding a campaign outside of the US, then only Visa and MasterCard will be accepted.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Apple Pay:</strong> Because Apple Pay is supported with huge support from major credit cards and
                the six
                largest banks in the U. S., and because it is also accepted in Canada, the UK, Australia and China,
                it is a preferred method of payment.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Other Payment Options?</strong> For other options such as cash, check, PayPal etc., please
                contact us at [wpv-bloginfo show="admin_email"]
                <br><br>
                <strong>Currency Restrictions:</strong> [wpv-bloginfo] is a company based in the U.S., and at the
                present time, we
                support only credit and debit payments in in US dollars ($), CAD ($), EUR (€), GBP (£), and AUD ($).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Stripe Restrictions:</strong> Payments may be denied if the billing country is different
                from the bank country.<br><br>

                <strong>Contribution Amount Restrictions:</strong> Donations and investments are limited to $50,000 per single
                transaction. It is possible to split contributions into multiple transactions. Please contact *** if
                you would like to claim a perk of more than $50,000.

                [wpv-bloginfo] is hopeful that every campaign will be successful. However, delays or roadblocks can arise in any situation and not every campaign is successful. We understand your desire to stay informed. Here are a few steps you can take to communicate the campaign to other potential donors and to the YouTubers involved to help make the collaboration become a reality.  <br><br>

              <strong>Reach out to the YouTubers via social media.</strong> Some YouTubers will respond quickly on social media, addressing public statements on Facebook and Twitter.  Always include the campaign’s hashtag.<br><br>

              <strong>Spread the word.</strong> Share the campaign with others and encourage them to donate their money towards a good cause.
<br><br>

                <strong>Be Sure to Use the Comments Tab.</strong> This tab, located on the campaign page, is the
                location designated for
                contributors and supporters to hash out all of their hesitations about a campaign. It can also be used as
                a location for sharing insights. One contributor might have insider information that others lack.
                By starting a conversation with other contributors, the creator may be compelled to post
                updates.<br><br>
